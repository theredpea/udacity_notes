On the other hand, seeing as only 180 women were admitted; the *low-rate* effect on a large number, the .sum() doesn't do much for women in total\n",

(and even if I were, I don't want to speculate about a gender preference for *more difficult things* ?), but I realize *aggregating on a different axis* is another way of *ignoring* gender, to see simply admission rates in each Major. Major B has lower admission rate; you're ~~more than twice as likely~~ almost three times as likely (2.78) to get admitted to Major A than Major B."
